  <h1> Convict Leasing Program to Convict Labor</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>In 1870 the Tennessee State Prison reached a deal with the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company, and established one of the nation's first convict leasing programs.</li>
    <li>In convict leasing, the prisoners earned little or no pay while the states, companies, and prisons themselves benefited profusely.</li>
    <li>Convict leasing was essentially slavery. Law enforcement offices across the South – where convict leasing was popular – began to levy more, often “bogus”, charges against African Americans across the region. Laws were enacted across the Southern states to specifically target Black Americans and put them behind bars in order to preserve slavery, just under a new name. This phenomenon can be seen in the sudden jump in the percentage of African Americans serving time in the Tennessee State Prison - a number that was rarely above 5% before the Civil War, but that hit 62% by 1869.</li>
  </ul>
