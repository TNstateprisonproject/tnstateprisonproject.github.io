  <h1> Convict Leasing Program & Convict Labor</h1>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>In 1870 the Tennessee State Prison reached a deal with the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company, and established one of the nation's first convict leasing programs.</li>
    <li>In convict leasing, the prisoners earned little or no pay while the states, companies, and prisons themselves benefited profusely.</li>
    <li>Convict leasing was essentially slavery. Law enforcement offices across the South – where convict leasing was popular – began to levy more, often “bogus”, charges against African Americans across the region. Laws were enacted across the Southern states to specifically target Black Americans and put them behind bars in order to preserve slavery, just under a new name. This phenomenon can be seen in the sudden jump in the percentage of African Americans serving time in the Tennessee State Prison - a number that was rarely above 5% before the Civil War, but that hit 62% by 1869.</li>
    <li>This program lasted for around 20 years but faced vehement pushback from both convicts and normal workers until the State Legislature passed the Penitentiary Act of 1893, which banned convict leasing.</li>
    <li>However, the end of the convict leasing program did not spell the end of convict labor in Tennessee. The Tennessee State Legislature mandated that convicts needed to be “gainfully employed” no matter what. Convict labor continued behind the new, 1898 prison’s walls with factories and a for-profit farm being built within the prison’s grounds. Prisoners continued for-profit work in a system designed to profit the state.</li>
    <li>Even today, convict labor is a divisive issue, as the practice still continues.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h1>Riots & Escapes</h1>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Several escape attempts and riots took place when the prison was still in operation.</li>
